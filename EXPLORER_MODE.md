# Explorer Mode Guide

Explorer Mode is a study tool that lets you learn anatomy interactively without the pressure of a game.

## How to Access

From the main menu at http://localhost:3000, click the **🔍 Explorer Mode** button.

Or go directly to: http://localhost:3000/explore

## Features

### Interactive Skeleton Diagram
- **Hover** over any bone to see it highlighted in **blue**
- **Click** to pin a bone and keep it highlighted in **green**
- Click again to unpin

### Real-Time Information Panel
As you hover or click on bones, you'll see:
